See a container of Cup Noodles at a convenience store and you might think of 
dorm rooms and cheap calories.

But there was a time when eating from the product’s iconic packaging exuded cosmopolitanism, 
when the on-the-go meal symbolized possibility – a Japanese industrial food with an American flair.

Cup Noodles – first marketed in Japan 50 years ago, on Sept. 18, 1971,
 with an English name, the “s” left off because of a translation mistake – are portable instant 
 ramen eaten with a fork straight from their white, red and gold cups.

I research how products move between America and Japan, 
creating new practices in the process. 
To me, Cup Noodles tell a story of crossing cultures, and their transpacific journey reveals
how Japan has viewed America since World War II.

A flash of inspiration

It is a story widely told in Japan: Cup Noodles were created by the same person who invented 
instant ramen, Ando Momofuku, who, in 1948, founded Nissin Foods.

Ando was born in Japan-occupied Taiwan and moved to Osaka in 1933. 
In war-torn Japan, Ando watched people line up to purchase cheap bowls of noodles from stands 
in black markets. The noodles were made from wheat flour donated by the United States to 
make bread, a food more filling but less common in the Japanese diet.

Ando wanted to make noodles people could easily eat at home, 
so he built a laboratory shed in his backyard.

After several failed attempts, inspiration struck in 1958. While observing his wife, 
Masako, frying tempura, he noticed that oil removed the moisture.

He then realized that fried and dried noodles could be remoisturized when boiled. 
Seasoning powder and dehydrated toppings could be added, making countless flavor 
combinations possible. Ando chose chicken for the first flavor because chicken 
soup seemed rich, nutritious and American.
